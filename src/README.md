# OFFAT - OFFensive Api Tester

![OffAT Logo](/assets/images/logos/offat-3.png)

Automatically Tests for vulnerabilities after generating tests from openapi specification file. Project is in Beta stage, so sometimes it might crash while running.

![UnDocumented petstore API endpoint HTTP method results](/assets/images/tests/offat-v0.5.0.png)

>  [!WARNING]  
>  At the moment HTTP 2/3 aren't supported since fasthttpclient is used under the hood to increase performance.

## Github Action

- Create github action secret `url` for your repo
- Setup github action workflow in your repo `.github/workflows/offat.yml`

```yml
name: OWASP OFFAT Sample Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - dev
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: "download OAS file"
        run: curl ${url} -o /tmp/oas.json
        env:
          url: ${{ secrets.url }}

      - name: "OWASP OFFAT CICD Scanner"
        uses: OWASP/OFFAT@main # OWASP/OFFAT@v0.20.0
        with:
          file: /tmp/oas.json # or ${{ secrets.url }}
          rate_limit: 120
          artifact_retention_days: 1
```

> Prefer locking action to specific version `OWASP/OFFAT@v0.20.0` instead of using `OWASP/OFFAT@main` and bump OFFAT action version after testing.

## Installation

### Using Go

- Clone repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OWASP/OFFAT
    ```

- Go source code is stored in src directory

    ```bash
    cd src
    ```

- Run Go install command

    ```bash
    go install ./...
    ```

### Using Containers

### Docker

- CLI Tool

  ```bash
  docker run --rm dmdhrumilmistry/offat -h
  ```

## Start OffAT

### CLI Tool

- Run offat

  ```bash
  offat -f oas.json              # using file
  offat -f https://example.com/docs.json  # using url
  ```

  > JSON and YAML formats are supported

- To get all the commands use `help`

  ```bash
  offat -h
  ```

- Save result in `json`

  ```bash
  offat -f oas.json -o output.json
  ```

- Get curl command for making requests

  ```bash
  jq -r '.[].concurrent_response.response.curl_command' output.json
  ```
  > `jq` tool is required to run above command

- Run tests only for endpoint paths matching regex pattern

  ```bash
  offat -f oas.yml -pr '/user'
  ```

- Add headers to requests

  ```bash
  offat -f oas.json -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer YourJWTToken'
  ```

- Run Test with Requests Rate Limited

  ```bash
  offat -f oas.json -r 1000
  ```

  > `r`: requests rate limit per second

- Use along with proxy

  ```bash
  # without ssl check
  offat -f oas.json -p http://localhost:8080 -o output.json

  # without ssl check
  offat -f oas.json -p http://localhost:8080 -o output.json -ns
  ```

  > Make sure that proxy can handle multiple requests at the same time

- For Data Leak detection, create a new data leakage detection file from this sample file [owasp-offat-data-leak-patterns.yml](https://gist.github.com/dmdhrumilmistry/cd43ac90fa28f3c6d9c1b87c56586103)
  
  ```bash
  offat -f oas.yaml -dl owasp-offat-data-leak-patterns.yml
  ```

>  [!WARNING]  
>  Remember to include only patterns whose data can be probably found in your APIs, 
>  since detection process can lead to CPU spikes.

<!-- - Use user provided inputs for generating tests

  ```bash
  offat -f oas.json -tdc test_data_config.yaml
  ```

  `test_data_config.yaml`
